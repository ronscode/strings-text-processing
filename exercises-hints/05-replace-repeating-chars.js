/* Write a function that receives a single string and ​replaces​ any sequence of the ​same letters​ with a single corresponding letter. 

1. Don't forget to write your function and call so you don't test and wonder why its not working. Like I just did. 
2. Create an empty array to hold the answer. 
3. Use a regular for loop to loop through the ".length" of the string, "if" the index of the current letter is not equal to the value of the previous index (hint! i -1) then .push(someString[i]) onto the answers array. 
4. Then just join the answers array and console log it. Ta da!
