/* The input will be a​ single string.
Find all​ special words ​starting with #​. Word is invalid if it has ​anything ​other​ ​than​ letters​. Print the words you found without the tag each on a new line. 

1. Solve it your way first! 
2. Create new array variable and .split(" ") into an array. 
3. Create another new array, the value is the result of a .filter() method. The array you'll filter is the array of strings. 
4. The condition for the filter should be if the indexOf("#"") is equal to zero. This means it starts with a #. Also check to make sure the length is more than 1. Don't want just a hashtag with no tag. 
5. Open up a "for of" loop and console log each word from the filtered array.
